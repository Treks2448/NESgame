This is a short game built as practice for coding. It is currently under construction.

To launch the game, simply open the Visual Studio solution and run in release mode.

The project is built on top of the Chili Framework. 
If you would like to see the source code that I have written, navigate to the categories titled "My Code ..."

Thank you!
